# Data Science - Python Basics

## For Reading

This is overall a basic python crash-course.
There are two main files that are highly suggested to read!
The first is [coding standards](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) to help with understanding python convention.
Conventions are used to allow developers to talk and work on the same level without wondering why a script is written a certain way.
The second file is regarding [installations](./INSTALLATIONS.md) for running python code.
If you do not have python installed on your computer, this file breaks down the process for both windows and mac users.

The guts of this course can be found in the `crash-course` directory.
In this directory you will find some `.md` files for reading.
These files will give some explanation, as well as examples, for some python fundamentals.

Files most recommended:
```
FND_01_FIRST_MODULE.md
FND_02_IMPORTING.md
FND_03_TYPES.md
FND_04_FUNCTIONS.md
FND_05_LOOPING.md
FND_06_COMPREHENSION.md
FND_08_DOCSTRING.md
FND_09_EXCEPTION_HANDLING.md
FND_10_DEBUGGING.md
FND_15_GENERATORS.md
FND_16_DUCK_TYPING.md
```

The remaining `.md` files, while informative, will unlikely be touched throughout this course.
Feel free to read through them as you please!
While reading through, do not be afraid to create files of your own and prove to yourself how these concepts get applied.

# The Python Way => (import this)

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
