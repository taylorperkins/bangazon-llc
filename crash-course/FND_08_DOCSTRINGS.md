# Documenting Modules, Classes, and Methods

Through this course, you will be documenting all of your code. In Python, you will be using docstrings to accomplish this. The wonderful thing about docstrings is that they are used by the built-in `help()` method in Python to provide information to other developers about the purpose, and description of your code.

You are strongly encourage to read the [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) developer guide for guidance on the standard conventions that the Python developer community uses for documentation.

We will be following the guideline below, and the instruction staff will be making sure that you conform to it.

> All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have docstrings.
