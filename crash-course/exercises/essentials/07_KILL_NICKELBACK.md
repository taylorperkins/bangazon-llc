# Kill Nickelback

In this exercises, you're going to use a conditional statement inside a comprehension.
Let's look at a basic example.

```python
nums = range(10)
small_numbers = [num for num in nums if num < 6]
# Only add numbers to the new list if the value is less than 6

words = ['big', 'red', 'dog', 'ate', 'his', 'food']
three_letters_words = [ word.title() for word in words if len(word) == 3 ]
```

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/sets && cd $_
touch nickelback.py
```

## Instructions

1. Define a set that contains tuples. Each tuple should contain two strings:
    1. The name of an artist
    1. A song by that artist

    Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. You can see a [list of their greatest hits](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Nickelback-1/dp/B00FFERTUK/) on Amazon.
    ```
    # Example set
    songs = {
        ('Nickelback', 'How You Remind Me'), 
        ('Will.i.am', 'That Power'),
        ('Miles Davis', 'Stella by Starlight'),
        ('Nickelback', 'Animals')
    }
    ```
2. Using a set comprehension, create a new set that contains all songs that were not performed by Nickelback.
